Yes I know this code is dogshit, but this thing is kinda fun to play with.

If you want to run it yourself you will need to serve it somehow.

I like [live-server](https://github.com/tapio/live-server#readme) as a dog simple way of serving this kind of thing while developing it. You could also use `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080` in the root of this repo.
